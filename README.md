## Installation

1. Install vscode, eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or the IDE of your choice.


2. Run `git clone https://github.com/ThisIsALegitUsername/ghost-client-v2.git`


2a. **Only applies if you're using linux** Run `chmod +x gradlew`


3. Run `./gradlew teavm`


4. If you're using vscode, install the extension "live server," go to the javascript folder, right click on `index.html`, and click "Open with Live Server"


4a. I'm unsure about the process for other IDES, but a surefire way to open is to go into the javascript folder, click on `index.html`, remove the loop that checks for local file opening, download everything in javascript and paste it into the same folder, and finally open `index.html`.
